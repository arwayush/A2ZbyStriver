/*
- They are like the arrays
- The vector class synchronizes each and individual operation, i.e. whenever we wants to perfrom some operation on the vector
   vector class will automatically applies a lock to that operation
- It means only one thread will access at the one time, another thread will not be able to access
- vectors are less efficient due to lock
